# GuessMyNumberGame
In this game, you will try to guess the number the computer has chosen.

First, you'll choose the range (for example- numbers from 1 to 100).

Now, start guessing! 

If your number is smaller than the number the computer has chosen, you'll receive a massage saying that (same for bigger).

That way, you could slowly find the correct number.

Go ahead and try to guess the right number with minimum attempts!
